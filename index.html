<h1>HACK110 Memory Game Project</h1>
  <p>Created by Eric Shyu and Julliana Evans.</p>

  <p>For hack110 we decided to create a single player memory game. 
  There is a grid composed of a 4x8 set of tiles with each tile containing
  a letter that can be matched with the letter in another tile. 
  The tiles will remain visible for 15 seconds then disappear.
  There is a turn counter, and after you sucessfully match all the tiles
  the game will rate how you did.
