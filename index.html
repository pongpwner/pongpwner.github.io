<h1>HACK110 Memory Game Project</h1>
  <p>Created by Eric Shyu and Julliana Evans.</p>

  <p>For hack110 we decided to create a single player memory game. 
  There is a grid composed of a 4x8 set of tiles with each tile containing
  a letter that can be matched with the letter in another tile. 
  The tiles will remain visible for 15 seconds then disappear.
  There is a turn counter, and after you sucessfully match all the tiles
  the game will rate how you did.
  </p>
  
  <h2> General Concepts Used </h2>
  <p>
    One of the biggest part of this project was using features from javafx. We imported labels and shapes from javafx. 
    We made use of the EventHandler interface for buttons as well as mouse events.  A method called fadeTransition was used to
    make the letters disappear and reappear.
   
    There were 3 counters used.  Booleans and else if statements were used in determining how well a player did.  
    We created mulitple classes.  We also created helper methods. For loops were used quite a bit as well.
